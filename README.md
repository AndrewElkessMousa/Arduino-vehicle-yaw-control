# Arduino Vehicle Yaw Control

Arduino-based vehicle control system that tracks a desired heading (yaw) and longitudinal velocity using an MPU6050 IMU, quadrature encoders, and the bicycle kinematic model. Implements PID-controlled steering and drive motors for autonomous motion.

## 🛠️ Features

- **Yaw tracking** via IMU (gyro integration)
- **Steering angle control** using encoder feedback and P-controller
- **Velocity regulation** of drive wheels with encoder-based speed estimation
- **Bicycle model** converts desired yaw rate → physical steering command
- Automatic stop when heading target is reached (±1° tolerance)
- Real-time serial monitoring at **115200 baud**

## 🔧 Configuration & Tuning

All key parameters are defined at the top of the main sketch. **Adjust these based on your hardware**:

```cpp
// Vehicle geometry
const float L = 0.27;                   // Wheelbase (m)
const float STEER_TICKS_PER_RAD = 1677; // Calibrate for your steering mechanism

// Control targets
float yawTarget = 60;   // Desired heading (degrees)
const float vTarget = 0.6; // Target speed (m/s)

// Controller gains — tune for your system’s response - TIP start with low gains and avoid adding the diffrential gain only of there are occilations 
float Ky_p = 1.2, Ky_d = 0.3;   // Yaw PD controller
float Kp_s = 12;                // Steering position P gain
float Kp_v = 250;               // Velocity P gain
